Ð’ata from the Yandex.Real Estate service - an archive of advertisements for apartments for sale in St. Petersburg and neighboring settlements. Data sample has been collected over the course of several years.
The main purpose of this project is to analyse and determine the real value of real estate given in the data sample. The analysis will  allow for building an automated system: it will track anomalies and fraudulent activity.
For each apartment for sale, two types of data are available. The first is entered by the user, the second is obtained automatically on the basis of map data. For example, the distance to the center, airport, nearest park and water body.
